Industrial Client–Server System for Battery Data Analysis

This project implements an industrial client–server system for processing and analyzing Li-ion battery sensor data using WCF services over TCP streaming.

The system supports session-based communication, input validation, fault handling, and event-driven notifications. Basic anomaly detection is implemented to identify abnormal sensor values (e.g. temperature spikes and invalid ranges), along with safe resource management using the Dispose pattern.

The project demonstrates concepts relevant to industrial systems, distributed communication, data integrity, and reliability considerations in networked environments.

Technologies: C#, WCF, TCP Streaming
